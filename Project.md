### DGPO

Description: Recent algorithms designed for reinforcement learning tasks focus on finding a single optimal solution. 
However, in many practical applications, it is important to develop reasonable agents with diverse strategies. 
In this paper, we propose an on-policy framework for discovering multiple strategies for the same task.
Experimental results show that our method efficiently finds diverse strategies in a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks.
